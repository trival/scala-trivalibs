// Gestures — Layer 3: DOM-free interpreters built on the pointer snapshot of an
// `InputState`. Each is constructed over an InputState and advanced once per
// render frame via `update()`; the query members (`delta`, `holding`) are then
// pure, idempotent reads of the last frame's result. Driving `update()` from the
// render loop (rather than mutating on read) keeps the reads safe to call any
// number of times and from multiple consumers. Adding new multi-finger gestures
// (pan / pinch / rotate) means adding more of these, with no change to the relay
// or InputState.
//
// The "driver" of single-pointer gestures is the front-most pointer in the
// appearance-ordered active list whose initiating button is `Primary` (which
// covers the left mouse button and every touch contact). This gives free,
// jump-free hand-off: when the driving pointer lifts while others remain down,
// the next one is promoted and the gesture continues from its current position.
