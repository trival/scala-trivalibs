    * runs forward, doubles back through the corner and runs forward again,
    * covering that patch three times. This pass prevents it by construction —
    * the widths come down, so the ribbon stays a valid ribbon, and there is no
    * special case anywhere downstream.
    *
    * Two limits bind, and the tighter one wins:
    *
    *   - **an isolated corner**, where the inner offsets of the two segments
    *     meet `halfWidth * tan(turn/2)` back along each of them, so that has to

    *   - **a run of small turns**, where no single vertex turns much but the
    *     line still comes round faster than the width allows. Over a window of
    *     arc length `s` carrying total turn `Δθ` the line achieves a radius of
    *     about `s / Δθ`, and the half width has to fit inside it.
    *
    * **Apply this after [[splitAtAngle]], to each fragment.** Before the split a
    * reversal corner is still an interior vertex turning by nearly `Pi`, so the
    * limit there collapses to nothing and takes the width with it; after it, the
    * corner is a fragment endpoint, which the split already handles.
    *
    * `factor` scales the result — below `1.0` leaves headroom, above `1.0`
    * allows a little folding back. `proximity` adds the non-local half of the
    * limit, which is off by default; see `maxHalfExtentAt` for what it costs
    * and when it is worth it. This is the `NarrowWidth` treatment: the
    * stroke visibly thins through a tight turn, and `uv.y` still spans the full
    * `0..1`, so a cross-stroke pattern stays complete and is squeezed rather
    * than clipped. Compare [[Line.narrowAtTightTurns]] against clamping the

  * it, `FoldTreatment.ClampInner` leaves the width alone and pulls the inner
  * vertex in to it.
  *
  * This is the line's **local feature size**: an offset curve stays free of
  * self-intersection exactly while the offset stays under the distance to the
  * medial axis, and that has a curvature part and a proximity part. Three
  * limits bind here, and the tightest wins.
  *
  * Curvature, which is local:
  *
  *   - **an isolated corner**, where the two inner offsets meet
  *     `halfExtent * tan(turn/2)` back along each segment and so have to fit
  *     inside the shorter neighbour;
  *   - **a run of small turns**, where no single vertex turns much but the line
  *     still comes round faster than the offset allows. Over a window of arc
  *     length `s` carrying total turn `Δθ` the line achieves a radius of about
  *     `s / Δθ`, and the offset has to fit inside that. The window grows
  *     outward, shorter side first, and stops once it is much wider than the
  *     limit it constrains — a window that large cannot tighten it further, and
  *     walking the whole line at every vertex would be quadratic.
  *
  * Proximity, which is not local at all, and **off unless asked for**:
  *
  *   - **another part of the line passing close by in space** while being far
  *     away along it. A narrow V that thickens along both arms is the pure
  *     case: every vertex turns gently, so no curvature test fires, yet each
  *     arm's inner edge reaches across the gap and through the other arm. The
  *     offset has to stay under half the distance to the nearest such point,
  *     half because both sides advance toward each other.
  *
  * What counts as "another part" is decided by the ratio of arc length to
  * straight-line distance — see [[proximityLimitAt]]. Without that exclusion a
  * vertex's own neighbours would constrain it and every line would collapse.
  *
  * Proximity is opt-in because it is the blunt half. The curvature limits are
  * exact and parameterless — they fall out of the geometry. Proximity needs two
  * thresholds picked by judgement, and it works by suppressing overlap, which a
  * stroke crossing itself deliberately wants to keep. It earns its place on a
  * stroke that folds close alongside itself and looks wrong for it, not by
  * default.
  *
  * A caveat before turning it on with `FoldTreatment.ClampInner`: that
  * treatment reads which side is "inner" from the turn direction, which is the
  * right question for a curvature limit and meaningless for a proximity one —
  * there the side that matters is the one facing the near part, and on a
  * near-straight run the turn direction is close to noise. Until that is fixed,
  * proximity pairs properly only with narrowing, which is symmetric and needs
