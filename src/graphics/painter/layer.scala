  * efficiency: epochs are per-panel counters, so two panels routinely share an
  * epoch value. A layer reused across panels must therefore key-mismatch on
  * `panelId` and rebuild — dropping `panelId` would let panel B reuse a bind
  * group that references panel A's textures (undefined rendering). Never remove
  * it from the key.
  *
  * `valueGroup` / `panelGroup` are null when the layer has no such group (mirrors
  * the build helpers' early-return, so the hit path skips `setBindGroup`).
