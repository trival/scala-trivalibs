/** Cross-stroke coordinates for geometry built by `Line.toBufferedGeometry`.
  *
  * `uv.y` must **not** be interpolated directly on a stroke whose width varies:
  * a width change shears each quad, and the rasterizer fits an affine function
  * to each of its two triangles independently, so iso-`v` lines kink at every
  * diagonal — a visible zig-zag along the stroke. The value wanted is
  * `(y + h) / 2h`, which is not affine and so cannot be interpolated, but *is* a
  * ratio of two affine functions. Interpolate those two separately and divide
  * per fragment.
  *
  * Pack in the vertex stage, unpack in the fragment stage:
  *
  * ```scala
  * type Varyings = (uv: Vec2, cross: Vec2)
  *
  * program.vert: ctx =>
  *   ctx.out.cross := lineCross(ctx.in.uv.y, ctx.in.width)
  *
  * program.frag: ctx =>
  *   val v = ctx.in.cross.lineV            // 0..1 across the stroke
  *   val d = ctx.in.cross.lineOffset       // world units from the centre line
  * ```
  *
  * Only the **cross** direction takes the divide. `uv.x` stays as it is: it is
  * arc length along the stroke, and dividing it too would make it hyperbolic
  * along a taper, stretching anything keyed on stroke progress toward the wide
  * end.
  *
  * One packed `cross` covers both uv sets. `uv` and `localUv` differ only in
  * `x` — the whole stroke against this fragment alone — and carry the identical
  * `y`, so pack once from either and pair the result with whichever along
  * coordinate is wanted. Packing `localUv.y` as well just spends a second
  * varying on the same number.
